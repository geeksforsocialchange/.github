## Hi there 👋

We're a trans and disabled-led community of people creating technology for community liberation. We welcome new members.

You can find out more about how to get involved on our [WIP community website](https://www.gfsc.community/)

The easiest way to get involved though is on our [Discord server](http://discord.gfsc.studio)!

Full organisational intro coming soon!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
